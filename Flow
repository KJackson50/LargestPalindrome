#'s to multiply - 100 - 999 (NEED TO MULTIPLY, NOT EVERY NUMBER IN 'PRODUCT RANGE' IS A MULTIPLE OF THE 3 DIGIT NUMBERS!!!!!)
product range - 10000 - 998001

-multiply the product of all three digit numbers
-loop through lowest to highest product / turn (int) into a String
-count digits in String / find Palindrome by checking the following
  -for 5 digits - check first and last && middle 3
  -for 5 digits - check first and last && 2nd and 4th
  -for 6 digits - check first and last && middle 4
  -for 6 digits - check first and last && 2nd and 5th && middle 2
-if any match, convert string to int / add to palindrome array
-if not, keep looping through product range
-at end find largest Palindrome in Palindrome array / print out
